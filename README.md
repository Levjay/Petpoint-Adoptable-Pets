# Petpoint-Adoptable-Pets
Code that allows us to post adoptable pets from Petpoint to our wordpress site.

Originally developed by George Flammer @glflam12 on Twitter.   http://www.gflam.com/

We have made some modifications, including conditionals for youtube videos, etc.

One item we hope to develop is a dynamically populating breed list from the XML.

A wordpress plugin isn't currently available, but would recommend referring to @PRDeltoid and project here https://github.com/PRDeltoid/Petpoint-Webservices.
